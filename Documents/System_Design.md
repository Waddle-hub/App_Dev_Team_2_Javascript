System design

## Introduction
A blog is a website that uses specific software to publish, publish, and post personal articles on the Web, or that is usually managed by individuals and posts new articles from time to time. Posts on blogs usually appear as web pages and are arranged in reverse order depending on when they were posted.Now popular with everyone, it is a personal "reader's digest" in the internet age, a web diary with hyperlinks as the entrance, which represents a new way of life, work and learning. Many blogs focus on providing comments or news on specific topics, while others are used as personal diaries. A typical blog combines text, images, links to other blogs or websites, and other topic-related media to allow readers to leave comments in an interactive way, which is an important element of many blogs

## Project plan

1. Blog Project

 3.2. Ma Mingke
 3.3. Yamen Saad Aldeen
 3.4. Wan Shiyi
 3.5. Yuldashov Rasul

5. Estimated Budget for the project is 20.000.000 Ft


## Overview
The team is developing a blog application in php, we want all CRUD functionality on posts, be able to register new accounts to create posts, and be able to log out of those accounts. our database is managed with phpmyadmin and is being hosted on a local server per machine for the sake of testing our application and making sure it works.

## Purpose
Describe the intent, application objectives, scope of action, and other background materials that should be explained to the reader about the software development. Explain the relationship between the developed software and other relevant software. This is explained if the software product is a stand-alone software and the entire contents are self-contained. If the defined product is an integral part of a larger system, the relationship between the product and the other components of the system should be described, the composition of the system and the links and interfaces between the product and the other components


## Context
Everyone at this time has the required knowledge to make this project work, we would like to see all pages implemented in the first month and having all the fucntionality in the second month. any remaining time can be spent on making the website look better. main causes for concern would be to get the full working application out as soon as possible to comply with deadlines and get our grades. the appearance of the website can be changed as the team feels, for us whatis important is to get the functionality out.
## Design
Page planning:

Front-end presentation: home page, detail page, category, register, login, about,comment

Background management: Template page



## Fuctionality
 1. Web browsing;

 2. The station owner logs in and logs out;

 3. Article management, publication, modification, comment, message, search, multimedia management (add, delete, modify), upload;

 4. Stationmaster management, add contributors, administrators;

 5. plug-in management, add, delete, set features, etc.

 6. Appearance management, title bar, archive classification, calendar, banner, message and other appearance addition, deletion, settings, etc


## Goals and Non-Goals

## Existing Solution
In addition to describing the current implementation, you should also walk through a high level example flow to illustrate how users interact with this system and/or how data flow through it.

An user story is a great way to frame this. Keep in mind that your system might have different types of users with different use cases.


## Proposed Solution
Some people call this the Technical Architecture section. Again, try to walk through a user story to concretize this. Feel free to include many sub-sections and diagrams.

Provide a big picture first, then fill in lots of details. Aim for a world where you can write this, then take a vacation on some deserted island, and another engineer on the team can just read it and implement the solution as you described.


## Alternative Solutions
What else did you consider when coming up with the solution above? What are the pros and cons of the alternatives? Have you considered buying a 3rd-party solution ' or using an open source one ' that solves this problem as opposed to building your own?


## Testability, Monitoring and Alerting
I like including this section, because people often treat this as an afterthought or skip it all together, and it almost always comes back to bite them later when things break and they have no idea how or why.


## Cross-Team Impact
How will this increase on call and dev-ops burden?
How much money will it cost?
Does it cause any latency regression to the system?
Does it expose any security vulnerabilities?
What are some negative consequences and side effects?
How might the support team communicate this to the customers?


## Open Questions
Any open issues that you aren't sure about, contentious decisions that you'd like readers to weigh in on, suggested future work, and so on. A tongue-in-cheek name for this section is the 'known unknowns'.


## Detailed Scoping and Timeline
This section is mostly going to be read only by the engineers working on this project, their tech leads, and their managers. Hence this section is at the end of the doc.

Essentially, this is the breakdown of how and when you plan on executing each part of the project. There's a lot that goes into scoping accurately, so you can read this post to learn more about scoping.

I tend to also treat this section of the design doc as an ongoing project task tracker, so I update this whenever my scoping estimate changes. But that's more of a personal preference.

## Reference Material
Throughout the process of system design we used amny reasources and references to make a very encompassing and successful system design document. we used :

https://www.its.dot.gov/research_archives/msaa/pdf/MSAA_SystemDesignFINAL.pdf System design template

https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~lacher/courses/COP3331/sdd.html as an example of how a system design document is written
