__Purpose__

Build a CMS ( content management system) from scratch using NodeJS, Express and MongoDB that can complete the functions of personal CMS users logging in,register, publishing, browsing, modifying articles and messages, comments,control comments and even personalizing the layout of sites.
the CMS can do a lot of stuff for the user. The purpose is to test our learning and developement skills, using technologies we are not familiar with showing that we as programmers understand the basic structure of code. if we can execute this project effectively we would show that we know how to code regardless of the language we are using. this can boost our confidence and make us better programmers. The project should display a good amount of technical skill which is why we are using a CMS, so we can manage many different types of content from images to text etc.

A user may view posts unlogged, but to comment and edit their own posts they must log in. As users log in they have the ability to create and edit their own posts with a special bar appearing in the navigation allowing them to access admin abilities where they will be able to edit all posts, remove comments, edit text of all posts. 

__Current Situation__

A blog is a website that uses specific software to publish, publish, and post personal articles on the Web, or that is usually managed by individuals and posts new articles from time to time.Blog is after MSN, BBS, ICQ, the emergence of the fourth way of network communication, has been welcomed by everyone, is the network era of personal "reader's digest", is a hyperlink as the entrance to the network diary, it represents a new way of life, work and learning. Many blogs focus on providing comments or news on specific topics, while others are used as personal diaries. A typical blog combines text, images, links to other blogs or websites, and other topic-related media to allow readers to leave an interactive message, which is an important element of many blogs.
We need to find new skills and show our understanding, this a perfect time to build a portfolio of well developed applications that show our ability to not only work in a team but develope effectively and adapt the changing requirements the business world will often throw upon us.

__Goal__

One of the goal is to know how to be a part of a team in the software industry, through some controlling tools like git, GitHub, and gitLab, also to get to use the task manager websites like Trello.com, and spread the tasks for each member of the team. But our main goal is to learn new technologies and show our ability to change at a moments notice giving us the import skills we need to work in this voltaile world where technology is constantly changing and getting better, we need to adapt with the times and show our abilities to do so. The goal of the application is to effectively edit and manipulate data given to us by users in a user friendly way. A user shouldnt have to figure out how to change the data there. it is important that we make a UI that can be undertsood and used easily by anyone, not just the developers who made it. This is an extra constraint we add on ourselves so we can truly see if we can make applications at a professional level. We want to make sure this application isnt all about the manipulation but also the user experience. If a user enjoys our design and is able to use the website with ease that can be considered a success. We as a team need to work together to make sure that our application can not only show off our skills in data manipulation and be a easy and enjoyable user experience, but also show how we can work as a team and these are the goals for our application.
